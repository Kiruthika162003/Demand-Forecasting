# Forecasting Future Sales

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast future sales using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to predict the total sales for each product and store combination in the next month. This can help businesses in inventory management, sales planning, and decision-making processes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical sales data. It includes the following files

- sales_train.csv This file contains the training data, including daily historical data of sales
- items.csv This file contains information about the items/products
- item_categories.csv This file contains information about the item categories
- shops.csv This file contains information about the shops/stores
- test.csv This file contains the test set, including the pairs of shop_id and item_id that need to be predicted

## Data Fields
- date The date of the sale (format dd/mm/yyyy)
- date_block_num A consecutive month number, used for convenience. January 2013 is 0, February 2013 is 1, and so on
- shop_id The unique identifier of the shop
- item_id The unique identifier of the item
- item_price The price of the item
- item_cnt_day The number of items sold on that day


## Results
The results of the project include the predicted sales for each product and store combination for the next month. These predictions can be used to optimize inventory levels, plan promotions, and make informed business decisions.
